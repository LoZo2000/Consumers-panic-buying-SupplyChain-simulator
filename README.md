# Consumers-panic-buying-SupplyChain-simulator
Agent-Based simulation of the Supply Chain of an Italian pasta producer and distribution company during the CoVid-19 pandemic. This group project is part of the final assignment of the course "Advanced Modelling Simulation 2023-2024" at Politecnico di Milano.  
Aim of this project is, given a simple base model (basic_model.py), to extend it and make it more realistic, to assess the robustness of the distribution network against disruptive events (such as, in this case, the pandemic and the following panic buying). The second goal is to optimize and tune the parameters of such model to guarantee a minimum level of performances.  
A better description of the problem is provided by the 'Assignment Description' files.  
Explanation of the code and of the changes implemented are available in the 'Presentation' files.
